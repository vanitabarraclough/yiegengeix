Couple months ago I set up this new machine with only two partitions: `/boot` and `/`, while encrypting my root partition and calling the encrypt kernel parameter directly on the UEFI motherboard, which worked exactly as I wanted to.

Winium is a Selenium-like automation tool that can be used with Windows desktop applications.
