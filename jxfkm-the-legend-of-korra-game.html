Before long, Korra's Avatar skills are put to the test when she encounters a group of Chi-blockers led by the charismatic and mysterious Amon, who threatens the city and all the benders in it. Despite the immense danger, Korra vows to fight the growing anti-bending revolution. While the visuals and cut scenes are great, the environments are admittedly sparse. Probably the only con for me. But this isn't a big budget title, and what matters is the game play. I had a blast with this game; they made great use of the Korra license to create a fun, challenging brawler. Does anyone know where i can buy the legend of korra 
So recently I discovered the several Avatar games that are out there, which blew my mind. Had no clue these even existed. Anyways, I was particularly interested in trying The Legends of Korra game, which appear to be the most recent release. After digging around a little, I still couldn't find any place to purchases the game. After digging a little deeper, I found out that either Steam simple deleted the game from their store or Activation shut it down. I was able to find a few of those. Hey everyone! Regrettably, I never downloaded the Legend of Korra game before it was removed from online downloads, and I would love to play it.

Could you guys give me some support? I know the game is short First time posting, I loved the graphics in The legend of Korra, but hated the story and the combat. Any suggestions. I've seen some reviews on it and it didn't really do all that well with critics and gaming YouTubers. Which is why I've been hesitant about buying or playing the game since it came out three years ago. But I love the Legend of Korra so yeah. Plus, I just want to get more direct opinions on it from people that have actually played the game. I've gotten games before that have received poor reviews and I ended up really enjoying them. I'm referring to the PlayStation version just to clarify. Hey everyone!

Could you guys give me some support? I know the game is short Reviews have been mixed so I'm wondering what you guys thought of the game so I can gain a better perspective. I am a huge fan of the show and the game lives up to its legacy. Platinum Games has done an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the show. There seems like so much value for 15 bucks. I totally recommend. If any of you guys are getting the game today, and want to review the game, give impressions, or if you have any questions, try out The Legend of Korra: The Game sub (https://www.reddit.com/r/Korrathegame/). I hope that you all would come and talk about it! If the mods don't like this post then I'll delete it, but I just thought it would be helpful.

Unfortunately, there hasn't been much coverage of the game other than what you see here, so I feel like promoting I really want an Avatar open world RPG in likes of Skyrim or even Oblivion and Morrowind. It'll probably be more like Skyrim in more ways than one (substitute dragonborn for Avatar). But I would love to play as a character who is just discovering that he or she maybe the Avatar and have to master all four elements as well as all other sub-elements. Perhaps the story could take place in the Avatar after Korra's time or even before Aang but after Wan. Plus tell me there is a possibility I know its a little late (I'm usually late on these sort of things) but I just bought the Legend of Korra game (sale for Cyber Monday) and I keep hearing lots of hate from both the internet and my friends. When I watched Liam and Woolie play it it looked fun, and based Platinum, so I'm kinda regretting buying.
