Hey guys. I've seen an influx of posts from recent grads looking to become financial advisors or go into similar programs. Most of these guys either don't have a finance background or went to a non-target that doesn't teach about career paths. I want to make this thread as an FAQ on why its generally not a good route to go and why, to avoid mass posts and to cut to the chase (ie removing the condescending answers from people disgusted they aren't going IB or into a similar field). 1. Financi. Going through old issues of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter and posting highlights in my own words. For anyone interested, I highly recommend signing up for the actual site at f4wonline ( and checking out the full archives. --- PREVIOUS YEARS ARCHIVE: 1991 (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4so8a9/wrestling_observer_rewind_12231991_final_post_for/) • 1992 (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/51m67r/wrestling_observer_rewind_dec_28_1. (Postscript: This post started with a very different title: "The entire group was plotting to kill my PC out of jealousy." In the course of writing the post, however, I was able to see that the group wasn't the RPG Horror Story; I was. Read on and I think you'll agree.) After graduating college about 15 years ago, I made some new friends at church, and was invited by one of them to join his gaming group. I played 3.5 daily for a few years in college (with a single It seems pretty cool to knock Pimsleur these days, so I'm here to give it a little love. For those of you who are already familiar with Pimsleur, you can skip the next 2 paragraphs. For those of you who don’t know what the hell a Pimsleur is, it’s an old-school language learning program based more or less on the audiolinguistic approach. When I say old-school, I mean it. It’s been around since 1963 and the program was originally offered on cassette tapes. Then it graduated 
Even as we're working on a new series behind the scenes ( more on that soon^^tm ), it's about time again for another mixer, discussion of craft, rambling on creativity, and what-have-you. We're over 38.5K subscribers now, which boggles the mind a bit - that when you're posting here, there's roughly the equivalent of a small town somewhere that (nominally) sees your work. Traffic-wise, we're around 15K uniques and 200k pageviews per month, with the majority share going to mobile apps. Despite the entrancing plot and compelling characters, her crime novel became an indistinguishable blur. On the third pass reading the same line over, Anna drowsily conceded defeat. Reluctantly she closed the book and put it on the nightstand. It was way past her normal bedtime and she didn’t want to be a sleep-deprived zombie at work. It wouldn’t be the first time a ‘page turner’ seduced her for an all-night reading binge. It was just that the sandman was more insistent. The next thing  Another season begins, and with it, new challenges, new excitement, and most of all, new hope. But how long will it take before that new hope becomes panic? For some, it will come sooner than others. But at the moment, everyone has an equal shot at glory. Captains will surely feel like they’ve drafted a team that can contend for a title. Players will surely feel they’ve developed enough to play a key role in the hunt for that title. So for now, the panic levels for all teams are minimal. # Preface With Joker ready to seize the ultimate treasure that is a spot on the roster (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmuTGcbu4Kc) today, I thought it'd be right to talk about what exactly Persona is, and why the hype is absolutely incredible right now. Persona has actually seen tremendously passionate adoration and considerable critical success for quite a while now - you may have heard about it in passing years ago - but it had stood as a cult classic, since the mainline games hadn't. Updated on 20 May 2019 All articles cited are from reliable and trustworthy news sources. (some may be NSFL): Major Incidents: King David Hotel Bombing (1946) where right-wing Zionist terrorists attacked a British HQ located within the hotel killing 91 and injuring 46.

I will preface this by saying that I am perhaps reading too much into this, to the point of putting significance on indefinite vs definite articles. But holy crap does Summerholm look different in retrospect of what we know Akua Sahelian. For all the hatred she has justly earned and for all that she ultimately lost, looking back she was a manipulator of stories that could play in the same league as everyone on screen with the possible exception of the Wandering Bard and perhaps Malicia.

Here's a letter I sent to my FIL a year ago that I've been meaning to post for a while now. I hope it helps others work through their own experience. While things like the CES Letter had their influence, I feel like the root of my leaving is in the simple question that many of you have asked yourself "What if the church isn't true?" and subsequently "Is there any way, physically or spiritually, to prove it's true?" If anything in my words resonates with you, let me know! tl;dnr: My Hero Academia greatly succeeds at humanizing its characters, primarily through the compassion and civility shown by the central character and protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, in his words and actions towards others within the narrative. It is also greatly inspired by, if not belonging to, the Bildungsroman ("coming-of-age") genre, of which "humanization" is one of its most important, core themes. ----------- This post is a rebuttal to YouTuber UniqueNameOSaurus's video "What. Hello. Collapse sucks. If you aren't already directly experiencing its' consequences, then you're at least learning about it - and its probably taking a toll on your mental health. Getting angry, sad and/or down about the news is 100% natural - nobody should doubt that, and nobody should be gaslighted for periods of negativity.

I’m struggling with engineering college right now. For one reason: I can’t study. I literally have a test tomorrow and I could very well get a good grade. I had a lot of free time to study and I’m actually pretty good at the subject. But I didn’t prepare well enough for it. I’m not simply lazy and irresponsible, even if I’m doing something else while I should be studying, I still feel guilty and get worried about it. But I don’t have even the slightest habit of studying. Ever since I always had an overactive imagination. And yeah, I could get overemotional. Not to mention I was always fucking weird. So I guess I couldn't blame the people of Stanwyck, Georgia when they didn't believe a werewolf killed my family. No, not many people believed me. Ashley Nelson, the quiet geek. A tall, fit black girl. Even then, I was lonely and constantly alienated by my classmates. My long wavy black hair and big browns eyes always besieged by restless mannerisms. Regardless of my quirky.
